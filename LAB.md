Complete [today's Kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/insert-dashes) 

## App

Build a searchable, sortable pokemon viewer. The lab includes the pokemon data you can use.

Basic structure is like:

```sh
+-------------------+
|  Filter and Sort  |
+-------------------+
|      Results      |
|◼️◻️◻️◼️◻️◻️◻️◻️◼️◻️◻️ |
|◻️◻️◼️◻️◻️◼️◻️◻️◼️◻️◻️ |
|◻️◻️◼️◻️◻️           |
|                   |
+-------------------+
```

## Components

```sh
App
 |
 +-- Header
 |    |
 |    +-- Filter
 |    |
 |    +-- Sort
 |
 +-- Results
      |
      + Tile
```

### App

Top-level container. Will mediate between Filter/Sort in Header and Results.

#### Header

Container for Filter and Sort

##### Filter

Offers controls for filtering. At a minimum allow:

* Filtering based on type (notice there are two possible matches for each pokemon)
* Pick at least one quantified attribute (attack, defence, etc.) and allow user to enter a minimum value. Make sure your input only allows whole, positive integer values.

##### Sort

Offer sorting based one of:

1. Pokemon name (default)
1. Type (use `type_1`)
1. Attack
1. Defence

#### Results

Receives the filtered and sorted results from app and generates `Tile` components.

##### Tile

Displays a pokemon image, name and relevant data (attack, defence, anything you used in filter/sort). Color code based on type. Feel free to put other attributes.
